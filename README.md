# burger
This is a full-stack burger app that uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, nodeJS, Express, Handlebars, mySQL, and ORM. 

## Overview of the organization of the app and how to use it
* the app uses express and NodeJS to create a server which provides front end html via the handlebars feature.
* the data on the burgers is stored in SQL and an ORM feature in the code is used to display, update and create new data in the SQL.  
* the user is able to devour a burger which leads to the burger being displayed in the eaten side of the html page. 
* the app then allows the user to create new burgers which are in an undevoured state and ready to be devoured.
